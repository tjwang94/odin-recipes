        <h3>Spam Fried Rice (its getting lazier)</h3>
        <p>Another dish that got me through college on a <strong><em>budget!</em></strong> 
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>half a can of spam</li>
                <li>white rice</li>
                <li>two eggs</li>
                <li>oyester sauce</li>
                <li>any other veggies you desire but I did not add anything else!</li>
               
                

            </ul>
        <h3>Steps! <em>Disclaimer I normally eye ball everything :)</em></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>chop your spam into small pieces or slices</li>
                <li>start with frying the spam on a pan</li>
                <li>move spam to the side and add eggs to scramble.</li>
                <li>once eggs start to take their shape you can mix the spam and eggs together and add your rice</li>
                <li>stir fry for a few minutes and add about a tbsp of oyster sauce.</li>
                <li>stir fry a few more minutes and you're done!</li>
                

            </ol>
